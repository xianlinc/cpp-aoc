## Switch statements
- When I tried incrementing an integer variable in the case block, there were unexpected results.
- Using an if else statement instead fixed this problem

## Exceptions
- You can't panic() and expect a nice error message like in golang, thrown exceptions need to be handled
- unhandled exceptions are pretty hard to read and unhelpful

## Reading from Stdin
- you can use `cin` 

## Streams
- read: `>>`
- read until newline, and get rid of it `getline()`
